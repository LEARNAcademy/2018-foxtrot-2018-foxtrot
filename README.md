## 8 - React and Rails
This week, we are going to dive back into React and learn how to build layered, full featured web applications.  By the end of the week, we'll be testing our code using automated tests, and communicating with the backend.

This week is also something of an experiment using Github to access all of the lessons and exercises in class.  The whole teaching staff is really excited to roll this platform out and share with you all the great tools that puts at our fingertips.  We welcome your feedback, and in fact, are going to need it to make sure that we're using the tools on Github as best we can.  Please help us help you accelerate your journey to being a software developer by perfecting our use of these great tools together.
