# LEARN Academy Github Classroom Workflow

LEARN utilizes a tool called Github classroom administer lessons and assignments. It's extremely valuable because it leverages the power of git and Github to version and track your assignments in a way that will closely match what you will experience as a developer. 

This guide will take you through the steps for getting started on the daily classroom challenges.

## Getting started with daily challenge

After a lesson, your instructor will drop a link to the lesson repo into Slack. This repo should have just about everything you need to get started with the challenges including the day's lesson, sample code from the lesson, and project folders where you can add your solutions to the challenges.

Here are the steps to using that link:

Given that you have a Github account:

1) Follow the link in Slack
  - It will open up a Github Classroom window that may prompt for an email. Skip this step.
2) You will then arrive at the Accept Assignment page where you can either 'Join an existing team' or 'Create a new team'
  - Click the Join button on your team's card or Create a new team to get started.
  - Github Classroom will then build your copy of the lesson repo where you can submit your work
  - You will then be sent to your new repo on Github
3) When on the repo page, click Clone or Download button on the right to copy the repo link
4) Then in a terminal window, navigate to your Desktop
5) Then run `git clone copied-url`
6) Configure your git user.name and user.email if you are working on a shared machine
7) Create a branch and start coding!
